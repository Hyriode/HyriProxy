HyriProxy is a proxy that works like a PlayerBalancer for multi-bungeecord. This project may have bugs because it was done in 2 days and it was not tested in real conditions. This project will not be used for Hyriode, in fact make a proxy in java with basic java system is not really good. If one day we need a proxy, we will make a better one using a native language or in java with netty.
